          Hello! My name is Kevin and I'm studying Computer Science at the
          National University of Singapore (NUS). I have a passion for software
          engineering as well as data structures and algorithms. I enjoy
          teaching at NUS and believe that everyone can learn Computer
          Science concepts well if they develop some level of intuition for
          them. My hobbies include baking, reading, and growth investing.
