                Slim Jeans Recipe Calorie Counter is a website which generates
                a recipe's caloric information based on its ingredients. I worked
                on this with my friend from NUS, Ryan Tan, as part of Orbital 2019.
                Orbital is NUS' summer project module which freshmen with the
                opportunity to hone their software engineering skills during the
                summer holidays. We decided to work on this project because we
                realised that many online recipes did not provide caloric information.
            </p>
            <div id="project-image-container">
              <img
                  alt="List of saved recipes"
                  src="/images/slim_jeans_saved_recipes.jpg"
              >
            </div>
            <p>
                We used HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript, and a templating language
                called Jinja2 to create the website's user interface. Python's
                Flask framework was chosen to run the backend code, with SQLite
                for the database. Additional libraries include BootStrap for CSS
                styling and Twitter's typeahead.js for our autocomplete feature.
                We did not use more popular front-end libraries such as React
                because we wanted to experience building a website from scratch.

            </div>
            <p>
                The project was a fruitful experience for us and taught us about
                working together in teams. During my freshman year in NUS, all of
                my programming assignments did not involve group work and I was
                used to completing my work in a certain way. This experience made
                me improve my communication skills and become more mindful about
                my own work. Feel free to visit the website
