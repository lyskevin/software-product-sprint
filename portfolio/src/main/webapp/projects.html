                Slim Jeans Recipe Calorie Counter is a website which generates
                a recipe's caloric information based on its ingredients. I worked
                on this with my friend from NUS, Ryan Tan, as part of Orbital 2019.
                Orbital is NUS' summer project module which freshmen with the
                opportunity to hone their software engineering skills during the
                summer holidays. We decided to work on this project because we
                realised that many online recipes did not provide caloric information.

              >
            </div>
            <p>
                We used HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript, and a templating language
                called Jinja2 to create the website's user interface. Python's
                Flask framework was chosen to run the backend code, with SQLite
                for the database. Additional libraries include BootStrap for CSS
                styling and Twitter's typeahead.js for our autocomplete feature.
                We did not use more popular front-end libraries such as React
                because we wanted to experience building a website from scratch.

                The project was a fruitful experience for us and taught us about
                working together in teams. During my freshman year in NUS, all of
                my programming assignments did not involve group work and I was
                used to completing my work in a certain way. This experience made
                me improve my communication skills and become more mindful about
                my own work. Feel free to visit the website

                Kattis is a website where users can upload or solve competitive
                programming questions. These questions normally require out of
                the box solutions which must be heavily optimised in order to pass
                the specified time limit. This is especially so if solutions are
                submitted in Java, which is slower than C++, the preferred language.

                I became a Teaching Assistant (TA) for a Data Structures and
                Algorithms module (CS2040) during my second year at NUS. I had
                taken this module during the prior semester and really enjoyed
                the thrill of solving the problems associated with it. The
                questions for the lab assignments that coming semester were all
                from Kattis. I decided to attempt at least one question every day
                and upload my code onto GitHub for easier reference. It has since
                become a habit for me and I believe that it will help with
                technical interviews in future. I am aware that my code might be
                plagiarised but better solutions exist online and it also defeats
                the purpose of one's learning if a student were to copy my code.

                Duke was a greenfield software engineering project that I
                worked on while taking a software engineering module (CS2103T)
                at NUS. The objective was to build a chatbot using Java and
                JavaFX while adhering to software engineering principles, such
                as having clean code, working with user specifications, following
                design patterns, and unit testing. This was my first software
                engineering project and it taught me that I still have a long way
                to go when it comes to designing and building software systems.
