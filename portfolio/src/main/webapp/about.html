              Before enrolling into NUS, I took an online computer science
              course (CS50's Introduction to Computer Science), which was my
              first proper introduction into the field. I found the lectures
              to be extremely interesting and the rigour of the problem sets
              gave me good challenges to tackle. This ignited my passion for
              the subject and I decided to switch majors from Information
              Systems to Computer Science after my first semester at NUS.

              Two years later, I have developed interests in the areas of
              software engineering and data structures and algorithms.
              More recently, I have started exploring the areas of Artificial
              Intelligence and Machine Learning, but I realise that I still have
              a long way to go, especially in terms of mathematical knowledge.
              I'm glad to have found my passion and am looking forward to
              continue learning from the amazing computer science community.

              I started teaching computer science at NUS back in 2019. The two
              modules which I teach are CS2030, Programming Methodology II, and
              CS2040, Data Structures and Algorithms. The former delves into
              object-oriented programming, functional programming, and medium
              scale software development in Java. The latter introduces students
              to the design and implementation of fundamental data structures and
              algorithms in Java.

              Having come from a background with no computer science experience,
              I believe that everyone can learn well as long as they have the right
              mindset for learning. I believe in intuition-based pedagogy; I try
              to ensure that students understand the topics well and encourage
              them to ask questions whenever they feel lost. Much of computer
              science is built on fundamental knowledge, just like how we design
              programs. I also place emphasis on practice since learning the
              theory is often insufficient to be able to execute on it well.
          </p>
          <p>
              I also teach mathematics at a tuition center. The tutees come from
              a diverse range of levels, from primary school all the way to junior
              college. I take a similar approach as compared to my teaching at NUS
              and I place more emphasis on understanding over rote learning.

              My interest in investing started when I was completing my National
              Service. I saw one of my friends checking his investment portfolio
              and inquired about it. Ever since then, I have been reading and
              investing when time permits. I invest in growth stocks because
              I see the most upside in them and am of the opinion that I can
              shoulder the risk. After all, I am not investing a significant
              amount of money at the moment and can afford to earn it back after
              graduation if I happen to lose it. I believe that managing my own
              money will teach me to become more financially literate and better
              prepare me for the working world.

              I enjoy cooking and baking, among other things. I used to watch
              food channels on cable television when I was younger and they
              inspired me to learn from them. I once heard a greate quote that
              we should cook to nurture, and not to impress. This thought always
              remains at the back of my mind when I am in the kitchen. Of course,
              I still do look for aesthetically pleasing recipes from time to time.
              Reading, gaming, and surfing social media sites take up the rest of
              my free time.
